The SQL Unique Key

does not allow duplicate values in a column of a table. It prevents two records from having same values in a column.

Unique Key is just an alternative to the Primary Key; as both Unique and Primary Key constraints ensure uniqueness in a column of the table

Following is the list of some key features of the Unique Key in an SQL database −

The unique key is similar to the primary key in a table, but it can accept NULL values, whereas the primary key does not.

It accepts only one NULL value.

It cannot have duplicate values.

It can also be used as a foreign key in another table.

A table can have more than one Unique column.



CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL


INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(1, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 );



CREATE TABLE BUYERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2)
);

INSERT INTO BUYERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(1, 'Rajesh', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 );


INSERT INTO BUYERS VALUES (2, 'Ramesh', 36, 'Chennai', 1700.00 );



Unique Key on an Existing Column
Until now, we have only seen how to define a Unique Key on a column while creating a new table. But, we can also add a unique key on an existing column of a table. This is done using the ALTER TABLE... ADD CONSTRAINT statement.

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS ADD CONSTRAINT
UNIQUE_ADDRESS UNIQUE(ADDRESS);


Dropping an SQL Unique Key
If you have already created a unique key on a column, you can drop it whenever it is not needed. To drop the Unique Key from the column of a table, you need to use the ALTER TABLE statement.

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS DROP CONSTRAINT UNIQUE_ADDRESS;


INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Ahmedabad', 1500.00 );
