SQL DROP VIEW Statement
The DROP VIEW statement in SQL is used to permanently delete a view from the database. Once dropped, the view and all associated permissions are removed, and it can no longer be queried or referenced unless recreated.

Important Note: This command deletes only the view definition from the database without affecting the original tables it is based on. It is an irreversible action, so it should be used with caution.

1. Drop Single View in SQL
To remove a specific view, use the DROP VIEW statement followed by the name of the view.

Syntax
SQL

DROP VIEW view_name;
Example
First, assume a table named CUSTOMERS exists with data. We create a view:

SQL

CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW2 AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
To drop this specific view:

SQL

DROP VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW2;
-- Output: Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Verification
If you try to query the view after dropping it:

SQL

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW2;
Error: ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'testdb.customers_view2' doesn't exist

2. Drop Multiple Views in SQL
SQL allows you to clean up several views simultaneously using a single statement.

Syntax
SQL

DROP VIEW view_name1, view_name2, ...;
Example
SQL

DROP VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW1, CUSTOMERS_VIEW3;
-- Output: Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
3. Drop Views Using IF EXISTS Clause
To avoid errors if a view has already been deleted or doesn't exist, use the IF EXISTS clause. This ensures the query is safely ignored rather than throwing an error.

Syntax
SQL

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;
Example
SQL

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS CUSTOMERS_VIEW3;
-- Output: Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
4. Deleting Records vs. Dropping a View
Rather than removing the entire view, you can delete specific rows using the DELETE statement.

Warning: If the view is updatable, this operation also removes the corresponding records from the actual base table.

Syntax
SQL

DELETE FROM view_name WHERE condition;
Example
SQL

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW3 WHERE AGE = 22;
Result: The record with AGE = 22 is removed from both CUSTOMERS_VIEW3 and the base CUSTOMERS table.

Restriction: This only works on updatable views. Views using JOIN, GROUP BY, or DISTINCT generally do not allow deletions.

5. View Dependency and Permissions
Table Dependencies: If a base table is dropped, any views depending on it are not automatically removed. They remain in the database but will fail when queried. You must drop them explicitly.

Permissions: To drop or modify a view, you typically need ALTER or CONTROL permissions on the schema.
