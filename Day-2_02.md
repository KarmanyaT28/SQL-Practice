SQL Server - Listing Tables
SQL Server does not provide SHOW TABLE command in an SQL Server. Instead, we can use the "SELECT" statement to retrieve information about tables in a database. We have three different commands to use with the SELECT statement to list all the tables in a database −

sys.tables

information_schema.tables

sysobjects

The SYS.TABLES View
Following is the syntax to list down all the tables in SQL using the SYS.TABLES view −

name	object_id	principal_id	schema_id
CUSTOMER	4195065	NULL	1
ORDERS	68195293	NULL	1
COMPANIES	100195407	NULL	1
SALARY	2107154552	NULL	1
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES View
Following is the syntax to list down all the tables in SQL using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES view −

SELECT table_name, table_type FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
Following is the output of the above query −

table_name	table_type
CUSTOMER	BASE TABLE
ORDERS	BASE TABLE
COMPANIES	BASE TABLE
SALARY	BASE TABLE
The SYSOBJECTS View
You can use SYSOBJECTS view to retrieve the information of all the objects created in SQL Server database, including stored procedures, views, system tables and user-defined tables. Following is the basic syntax of using sysobjects view −

SELECT name, id, xtype FROM sysobjects WHERE xtype = 'U';
