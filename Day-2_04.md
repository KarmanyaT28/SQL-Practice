Truncate Table

SQL TRUNCATE TABLE Statement
The SQL TRUNCATE TABLE command is used to remove all records from a table without deleting the table itself (i.e. empty a table). The table remains in the database, and you can insert new data into it later.

Syntax
The basic syntax of a TRUNCATE TABLE command in SQL is as follows:

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;


Example
First let us create a table CUSTOMERS4 which can store the personal details of customers including their name, age, address and salary etc. as shown below:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS4 (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);


INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
(4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
(5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );




mysql> Create table customers4 (
    -> ID INT NOT NULL,
    -> NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
    -> AGE int not null,
    -> address char (25),
    -> salary decimal (18,2),
    -> primary key (id)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.030 sec)

mysql> show tables;
+-----------------------+

6 rows in set (0.006 sec)

mysql> select * from customers4;
Empty set (0.004 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
    -> (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
    -> (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
    -> (3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
    -> (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
    -> (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
    -> (6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
    -> (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );
Query OK, 7 rows affected (0.006 sec)
Records: 7  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> truncate table customers4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.021 sec)

mysql> select * from customers4;
Empty set (0.003 sec)

SQL: DELETE vs TRUNCATE
DELETE

Deletes one or more rows using a WHERE clause.

It is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command.

Changes require a manual COMMIT to be saved permanently.

Deletes rows one by one and logs each transaction.

Supports WHERE clause to filter rows.

Uses row-level locks.

Consumes more transaction log space.

Does not reset identity / auto-increment values.

Requires DELETE permission.

Slower for large datasets.

TRUNCATE

Deletes all rows from a table (no condition allowed).

It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.

Automatically commits; rollback is not possible in most systems.

Removes data in one operation with minimal logging.

Does not support WHERE clause.

Uses a table-level lock.

Consumes less log space (only page deallocations are logged).

Resets identity / auto-increment values to the initial seed.

Requires ALTER permission.

Much faster for large datasets.

SQL: DROP vs TRUNCATE
DROP

Completely removes the table from the database.

Deletes data, structure, constraints, and indexes.

It is a DDL command.

Frees table space from memory.

Table cannot be used again unless recreated.

Requires ALTER and CONTROL permissions.

Faster than DELETE but slower than TRUNCATE.

TRUNCATE

Removes only the data, not the table itself.

Table structure, constraints, and indexes remain intact.

It is a DDL command.

Table remains in the database and memory.

Table can be used immediately after truncation.

Requires only ALTER permission.

Faster than both DROP and DELETE.

Important Points About TRUNCATE TABLE

TRUNCATE removes all rows very quickly.

WHERE clause cannot be used.

Table structure remains unchanged.

Auto-increment / identity values are reset in most databases.

TRUNCATE is not reversible in most databases.

Rollback is possible only if the DB supports transactional DDL.
