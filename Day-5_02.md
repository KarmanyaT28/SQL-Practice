Important Points About CREATE VIEW
Following are the important points to remember when creating views in SQL:

Views do not store data, they display data from underlying tables in real-time.
You can query, filter, and join views just like normal tables.
Use CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW to update a view.
To remove a view, use DROP VIEW.
Views are supported in most relational database systems including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.



CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);



INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
(4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
(5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );





CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;



SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW;


UPDATE CUSTOMERS_VIEW 
SET AGE = 35 WHERE name = 'Ramesh';


SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW WHERE NAME ='Ramesh';




Example
The following query will update the ADDRESS of a customer whose ID is 6 in the CUSTOMERS_VIEW.

UPDATE CUSTOMERS_VIEW SET ADDRESS = 'Pune' WHERE ID = 6;




SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW WHERE ID=6;



Updating Multiple Rows and Columns
Using UPDATE statement, multiple rows and columns in a view/table can also be updated. While updating multiple rows, specify the condition in a WHERE clause such that only required rows would satisfy it.

Example
Following query updates the NAME and AGE column values in the CUSTOMERS_VIEW of the record with ID value 3.

UPDATE CUSTOMERS_VIEW
SET NAME = 'Kaushik Ramanujan', AGE = 24
WHERE ID = 3;


SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW WHERE ID = 3;


Example
But if you want to modify/update the age values of all the records in the CUSTOMERS_VIEW, there is no need to use the WHERE clause.

UPDATE CUSTOMERS_VIEW SET AGE = AGE+6;



SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW;
