Types of SQL Constraints
Following are the common types of SQL constraints:

NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are different.
PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity by linking to the primary key of another table.
CHECK: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified.


Example
In the following example, we create a CUSTOMERS table where the ID and NAME columns are marked as NOT NULL. This means every customer must have an ID and a Name:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

Verification
You can test the constraint by trying to insert a row with missing values:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID) VALUES (101);



Example
In the following example, we create a CUSTOMERS table where the EMAIL column is marked as UNIQUE. This means no two customers can have the same email address:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   EMAIL VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);


Verification
You can test the constraint by inserting rows with the same email:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, EMAIL) VALUES (1, 'Khilan', 'khilan@example.com');
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, EMAIL) VALUES (2, 'Kaushik', 'khilan@example.com');



Example
In the following example, we create a CUSTOMERS table where the ID column is defined as the PRIMARY KEY. This means each customer must have a unique ID, and it cannot be null:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(50),
   EMAIL VARCHAR(100)
);

Verification
You can test the constraint by inserting two rows with the same ID value:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, EMAIL) VALUES (1, 'Khilan', 'khilan@example.com');
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, EMAIL) VALUES (1, 'Kaushik', 'kaushik@example.com');



Example
In the following example, we first create a DEPARTMENTS table with DEPT_ID as its primary key. Then, we create a CUSTOMERS table where DEPT_ID is a foreign key that references the DEPT_ID column of the DEPARTMENTS table:

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENTS (
   DEPT_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   DEPT_NAME VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(50),
   DEPT_ID INT,
   FOREIGN KEY (DEPT_ID) REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS(DEPT_ID)
);

Verification
You can test the foreign key constraint by trying to insert a record in the CUSTOMERS table with a DEPT_ID that doesn't exist in the DEPARTMENTS table:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, DEPT_ID) VALUES (1, 'Khilan', 10);




Example
In the following example, we create a CUSTOMERS table with a CHECK constraint on the AGE column to ensure only customers aged 18 or older are allowed:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(50),
   AGE INT CHECK (AGE >= 18)
);

Verification
You can test the constraint by trying to insert a record with an age below 18:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, AGE) VALUES (1, 'Ramesh', 15);




Example
In the following example, we create a CUSTOMERS table where the SALARY column has a default value of 5000.00. If a user inserts a row without specifying the salary, this default value will be used:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(50),
   SALARY DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 5000.00
);

Verification
You can test the default value by inserting a row without providing a value for SALARY:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME) VALUES (1, 'Komal');







Using Multiple Constraints Together
In SQL, you can apply multiple constraints to a single column or across multiple columns in a table.

For example, a column can be defined as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and also have a DEFAULT value. Additionally, table-level constraints like PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY can also be combined for complete data validation.



Example
In the example below, we create a CUSTOMERS table that uses multiple constraints. The ID column is a PRIMARY KEY (which also implies NOT NULL and UNIQUE), the NAME column cannot be NULL, and the SALARY column has a default value. A CHECK constraint is applied on AGE to ensure only adults are added:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   EMAIL VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
   AGE INT CHECK (AGE >= 18),
   SALARY DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 5000.00
);


Verification
You can verify this by inserting a valid and an invalid record as shown below:

-- Valid record
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, EMAIL, AGE) VALUES (1, 'Ravi', 'ravi@mail.com', 22);

-- Invalid record (violates CHECK constraint on AGE)
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, EMAIL, AGE) VALUES (2, 'Ankit', 'ankit@mail.com', 16);






Example: Add NOT NULL Constraint
Suppose the NAME column in the CUSTOMERS table was initially allowed to have NULL values. You can now modify it to disallow NULLs:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS 
MODIFY NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;



Example: Add CHECK Constraint
If you want to ensure that the SALARY column always contains positive values, you can add a CHECK constraint:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (SALARY > 0);


Verification
You can verify these changes by inserting a record that violates the constraints:

-- This will fail because NAME cannot be NULL
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, SALARY) VALUES (101, 4500);

-- This will fail due to the CHECK constraint on SALARY
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, SALARY) VALUES (102, 'Anita', -2000);
