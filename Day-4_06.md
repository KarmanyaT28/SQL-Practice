SQL DELETE Statement

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
(4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
(5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );


DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE ID = 2;

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY < 3000;

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS;


Rolling Back DELETE Operations


BEGIN TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- If needed, undo the deletion
ROLLBACK;

-- Or, to make changes permanent
COMMIT;


Example
In this example, the deletion of the customer with ID = 3 is undone because of the ROLLBACK command. The row remains in the table:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE ID = 3;

-- Oops! That was a mistake
ROLLBACK;


SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
