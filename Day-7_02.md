The SQL DELETE JOIN
A DELETE JOIN in SQL is used to remove rows from a table based on a condition that involves another table. It combines the DELETE statement with a join, allowing you to target specific rows that match between two or more tables.

This is useful when you need to delete related records in one table that depend on values in another.

Syntax


```bash
DELETE table1, table2
FROM table1 JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field
WHERE table2.some_column = 'value';
```


```bash
DELETE a
FROM CUSTOMERS AS a INNER JOIN ORDERS AS b
ON a.ID = b.CUSTOMER_ID;
```

```bash
DELETE a
FROM CUSTOMERS AS a INNER JOIN ORDERS AS b
ON a.ID = b.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE a.SALARY < 2000.00;
  ```





Syntax
Following is the syntax of the SQL UNION operator:
```bash
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION
SELECT * FROM table2;
```
