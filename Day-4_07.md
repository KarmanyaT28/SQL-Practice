Sorting Results in a Preferred Order

One can also sort the records of a table in their own preferred order using the CASE statement within the ORDER BY clause. All the values are specified in the clause along with the position they are supposed to be sorted in; if the values are not given any number, they are automatically sorted in ascending order.

Example
To fetch the rows with their own preferred order, the SELECT query used would be as follows −

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
ORDER BY ( CASE ADDRESS
   WHEN 'DELHI' 	 THEN 1
   WHEN 'BHOPAL' 	 THEN 2
   WHEN 'KOTA' 	 THEN 3
   WHEN 'AHMEDABAD' THEN 4
   WHEN 'Hyderabad' 	THEN 5
   ELSE 100 END) ASC, ADDRESS DESC;
