SQL Joins

The JOIN clause in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables as if they were a single table.

Using JOIN helps in organizing data stored in different tables and returning a meaningful dataset.


```bash
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

```


Types of SQL JOINS
There are different types of SQL joins used to combine data from multiple tables. They are as follows:

INNER JOIN returns only the records that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and matching ones from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table and matching ones from the left table.
FULL JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either table.
SELF JOIN is a join where a table is joined with itself to compare rows within the same table.
CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, pairing each row from one table with all rows from the other.





Syntax for INNER Join

```bash
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```


```bash
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```


```bash
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00),
(4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00),
(5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00);
```



```bash

CREATE TABLE ORDERS (
   OID INT NOT NULL,
   DATE DATETIME NOT NULL,
   CUSTOMER_ID INT NOT NULL,
   AMOUNT INT NOT NULL,      
   PRIMARY KEY (OID)
);

```



```bash

INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES
(102, '2009-10-08 00:00:00', 3, 3000),
(100, '2009-10-08 00:00:00', 3, 1500),
(101, '2009-11-20 00:00:00', 2, 1560),
(103, '2008-05-20 00:00:00', 4, 2060);

```

INNER Join Syntax

```bash

SELECT CUSTOMERS.ID, CUSTOMERS.NAME, ORDERS.AMOUNT
FROM CUSTOMERS
INNER JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;


```

Left Join Syntax

```bash
SELECT CUSTOMERS.ID, CUSTOMERS.NAME, ORDERS.AMOUNT
FROM CUSTOMERS
LEFT JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;
```


RIGHT JOIN Syntax

```bash

SELECT CUSTOMERS.ID, CUSTOMERS.NAME, ORDERS.AMOUNT
FROM CUSTOMERS
RIGHT JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;

```



Full Join Syntax SQL Server


```bash

SELECT CUSTOMERS.ID, CUSTOMERS.NAME, ORDERS.AMOUNT
FROM CUSTOMERS
FULL JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;


```


Self Join Syntax

```bash

SELECT A.NAME AS CUSTOMER1, B.NAME AS CUSTOMER2, A.AGE
FROM CUSTOMERS A, CUSTOMERS B
WHERE A.AGE = B.AGE AND A.ID <> B.ID;

```



Cross Join Syntax

```bash

SELECT CUSTOMERS.NAME, ORDERS.OID
FROM CUSTOMERS
CROSS JOIN ORDERS;

```



multiple table joins


```bash

CREATE TABLE PAYMENTS (
   PID INT NOT NULL,
   OID INT NOT NULL,
   PAYMENT_DATE DATETIME NOT NULL,
   AMOUNT DECIMAL(10,2),
   PRIMARY KEY (PID)
);

```


```bash
INSERT INTO PAYMENTS VALUES
(1, 102, '2009-10-10 00:00:00', 3000.00),
(2, 101, '2009-11-22 00:00:00', 1560.00),
(3, 103, '2008-05-22 00:00:00', 2060.00);
```


```bash

SELECT CUSTOMERS.NAME, ORDERS.AMOUNT, PAYMENTS.PAYMENT_DATE
FROM CUSTOMERS
INNER JOIN ORDERS ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID
INNER JOIN PAYMENTS ON ORDERS.OID = PAYMENTS.OID;

```
