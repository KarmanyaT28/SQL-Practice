1.Show Databases
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'test%';
SHOW SCHEMAS LIKE 'test%';
2.The SELECT...FROM Statement
If you are working with MS SQL Server then you can use the SELECT...FROM statement to list down all the available databases as shown below.

SQL> SELECT * FROM sys.databases;

3.The EXEC sp_databases Statement
If you are using MS SQL Server then you can use the following EXEC sp_databases statement to list down all the databases −

SQL> EXEC sp_databases;


SQL BACKUP DATABASE



Syntax
Following is the syntax to back up a database in SQL Server:
BACKUP DATABASE database_name
TO DISK = 'file_path.bak';



Syntax
Following is the syntax to use WITH INIT to replace an existing backup file:
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\filename_backup.bak'
WITH INIT;





Types of Backups in SQL
In SQL Server, there are three main types of backups you can perform. Each type helps to protect your data in a different way and allows you to restore it depending on your needs. The three types are as follows:

Full Backup
Differential Backup
Transaction Log (T-log) Backup


******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************



Full Backup
A Full Backup in SQL saves a complete copy of the entire database. It includes all tables, data, and objects at the time of the backup. This backup can fully restore the database if needed. It is the most complete type of backup.

Syntax

Following is the syntax to take a full backup of a database in SQL Server:

BACKUP DATABASE database_name 
TO DISK = 'file_path.bak';
Example

In this example, we create a full backup of the testDB database and store it in the D:\Backups folder:

BACKUP DATABASE testDB 
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\testDB_backup.bak';
We get the output as shown below:

Processed 376 pages for database 'testDB', file 'testDB' on file 2.
Processed 2 pages for database 'testDB', file 'testDB_log' on file 2.
BACKUP DATABASE successfully processed 378 pages in 0.025 seconds (117.968 MB/sec).
Differential Backup
A Differential Backup in SQL saves only the data that has changed since the last full backup. It is faster and smaller than a full backup, but it depends on the last full backup to restore the database completely.

Syntax

Following is the syntax to take a differential backup of a database in SQL Server:

 
BACKUP DATABASE database_name 
TO DISK = 'file_path.bak' WITH DIFFERENTIAL; 
Example

In this example, we create a differential backup of the testDB database and store it in the D:\Backups folder:

 
BACKUP DATABASE testDB 
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\testDB_diff.bak' WITH DIFFERENTIAL; 
We get the output as shown below:

 
Processed 56 pages for database 'testDB', file 'testDB' on file 1.
Processed 2 pages for database 'testDB', file 'testDB_log' on file 1.
BACKUP DATABASE WITH DIFFERENTIAL successfully processed 58 pages in 0.016 seconds (28.076 MB/sec).
Transaction Log (T-log) Backup
A Transaction Log (T-log) Backup in SQL saves a record of all the changes (called transactions) made to the database since the last time a log backup was taken. This type of backup is important because:

It lets you restore the database to a specific point in time, like right before a mistake or crash happened.
It prevents the transaction log file from growing too large, which helps keep the system running smoothly.
Syntax

Following is the syntax to take a transaction log backup of a database in SQL Server:

 
BACKUP LOG database_name 
TO DISK = 'file_path.trn'; 
Example

In this example, we create a transaction log backup of the testDB database and store it in the D:\Backups folder:

 
BACKUP LOG testDB 
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\testDB_log.trn'; 
We get the output as shown below:

 
Processed 2 pages for database 'testDB', file 'testDB_log' on file 4. 
BACKUP LOG successfully processed 2 pages in 0.002 seconds (5.234 MB/sec).
