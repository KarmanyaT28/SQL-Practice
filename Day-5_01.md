SQL Views

SQL Create View Statement

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);


INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
(4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
(5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );



CREATE VIEW CUSTOMER_SALARY_VIEW AS
SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY
FROM CUSTOMERS;



Verification: 

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_SALARY_VIEW;


SQL View with WHERE Clause

CREATE VIEW HIGH_EARNERS AS
SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 2000;


SELECT * FROM HIGH_EARNERS;



Using Joins in Views
You can create views using JOIN operations to combine and present data from multiple related tables as a single virtual table.

The view can include selected columns from each table and can even apply filters using a WHERE clause.

Example
Assume you have another table named ORDERS having the following structure:

<img width="723" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/646a5bea-7a0d-426f-b414-1c2a43ec6c6e" />





CREATE VIEW CUSTOMER_ORDERS_VIEW AS
SELECT C.ID, C.NAME, O.ORDER_ID
FROM CUSTOMERS C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.ID = O.CUSTOMER_ID;


SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS_VIEW;


Modifying Views in SQL
You can change the definition of an existing view using the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement. This is useful when you want to update the columns or logic in the view without dropping and recreating it manually.



CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW CUSTOMER_SALARY_VIEW AS
SELECT ID, NAME, AGE, SALARY
FROM CUSTOMERS;



Verification
To verify that the view has been updated, you can query it like a regular table:

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_SALARY_VIEW;



Dropping a View in SQL
If a view is no longer needed, you can remove it using the DROP VIEW statement.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax to drop a view in SQL:

DROP VIEW view_name;


DROP VIEW CUSTOMER_SALARY_VIEW;



Verification
After dropping the view, trying to query it will result in an error:

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_SALARY_VIEW;
