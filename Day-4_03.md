SQL SELECT INTO Statement

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
(4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
(5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );


SELECT * INTO CUSTOMERS_BACKUP
FROM CUSTOMERS;



SELECT ID, NAME INTO CUSTOMER_NAMES
FROM CUSTOMERS;


SELECT * INTO CUSTOMERS_OVER25
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE AGE > 25;


Copying from Joins Using SELECT INTO

Example
Assume you have another table named ORDERS having the following structure:

ORDER_ID	CUSTOMER_ID	AMOUNT	ORDER_DATE
101	1	250	2025-07-01
102	2	300	2025-07-03
103	1	150	2025-07-05
Now, the following query joins the CUSTOMERS and ORDERS tables using the customer ID, and copies the matching data into a new table named CUSTOMER_ORDERS. The new table will include customer ID, name, order ID, and amount for each order:

SELECT C.ID, C.NAME, O.ORDER_ID, O.AMOUNT
INTO CUSTOMER_ORDERS
FROM CUSTOMERS C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.ID = O.CUSTOMER_ID;


SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS;
