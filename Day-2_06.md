The SQL Temporary Table
A Temporary Table in SQL is a special type of table that only exists during your current database session. It is created using the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement and is only visible to the session (or user) that created it.

Once the session ends or the connection is closed, the table is automatically deleted. Temporary tables do not affect the actual database structure. They are useful when you want to:

Store results in the middle of complex queries.
Split (break) a big task into smaller steps.
Use data temporarily without saving it permanently in the main database.



Creating Temporary Tables in SQL
To create temporary tables in SQL, you use a query similar to creating regular tables. The only difference is that instead of using the CREATE TABLE statement, you use CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax to create a temporary table in SQL:
```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  ...
  columnN datatype,
  PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )
);
```


Here:

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE: It is the SQL command to create a temporary table.
table_name: It is the name of the temporary table (usually prefixed).
column1, column2, ...: These are the names of the columns to store data.
datatype: These are the type of data each column holds, like INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.



Example
Let us create a temporary table named CUSTOMERS in SQL:

```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

Inserting Data into Temporary Table
We can insert data into the temporary table just like any regular table using the INSERT INTO statement.

```bash
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 );
```

```bash
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE table_name;
```
```bash
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE CUSTOMERS;
```

Local Temporary Tables
A Local Temporary Table in SQL Server is accessible only within the session (or connection) that created it. It is automatically deleted when the session is closed.

If a local temporary table is created inside a stored procedure, it is dropped automatically as soon as the stored procedure finishes execution.

Syntax

To create a local temporary table in SQL Server, use a single hash (#) as a prefix to the table name, as shown below:
```bash
CREATE TABLE #table_name (
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   column3 datatype,
   ...
   columnN datatype,
   PRIMARY KEY (one or more columns)
);
```
Example

Let us create a local temporary table named #CUSTOMERS in SQL Server:

```bash
CREATE TABLE #CUSTOMERS (
   ID       INT NOT NULL,
   NAME     VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   AGE      INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR(25),
   SALARY   DECIMAL(18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```


Global Temporary Tables
A Global Temporary Table is accessible to all sessions and connections on the SQL Server. However, it remains available only as long as at least one session is actively using it. Once the last session referencing the table is closed, the table is automatically dropped.

Syntax

To create a global temporary table, use a double hash (##) prefix before the table name, as shown below:
```bash
CREATE TABLE ##table_name (
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   column3 datatype,
   ...
   columnN datatype,
   PRIMARY KEY (one or more columns)
);
```


Example

Let us create a global temporary table named ##Buyers in SQL Server:
```bash
CREATE TABLE ##Buyers (
   ID       INT NOT NULL,
   NAME     VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   AGE      INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR(25),
   SALARY   DECIMAL(18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```
