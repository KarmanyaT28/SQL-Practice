The SQL Composite Key
An SQL Composite Key is a key that can be defined on two or more columns in a table to uniquely identify any record. It can also be described as a Primary Key created on multiple columns.

Features of Composite Keys
Following are some important features of the SQL Composite Key −

A Composite Key can be created by combining more than one Candidate Key.
Each Candidate Key (or column) that makes up a Composite Key may or may not be a Foreign Key. However, if all the columns of the Composite Key are Foreign Keys in their own right, then the Composite Key is known as a Compound Key.
A Composite Key cannot be NULL; i.e. any column of the Composite Key must not contain NULL values.
The individual columns making up the Composite Key can contain duplicate values, but, the combination of these columns must be unique across the database table.



Example
In the following example, we are creating a table named CUSTOMERS with multiple columns. The Composite Key is created when a PRIMARY KEY is defined on ID and NAME columns together. Look at the query below −

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID INT NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
   AGE INT NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   CONSTRAINT ck_customers 
   PRIMARY KEY (ID, NAME)
);

Verification
As we have created a Composite Key on the columns ID and NAME of the CUSTOMERS table, the combination of values in these columns can not be duplicated. To verify it, let us insert two records with same values in these columns into the CUSTOMERS table −

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
(1, 'Ramesh', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 );



ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS DROP PRIMARY KEY;

Verification
Since, we have dropped the composite from the CUSTOMERS table, so now you can insert the duplicate values in the columns ID and NAME.

Let us insert two records with the same ID and NAME into the CUSTOMERS table −

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(1, 'Ramesh', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 );



The SQL Alternate Key
SQL Alternate Keys in a database table are candidate keys that are not currently selected as a primary key. They can be used to uniquely identify a tuple(or a record) in a table.

Features of Alternate Keys
Following are some important properties/features of alternate keys:

The alternate key does not allow duplicate values.
A table can have more than one alternate keys.
The alternate key can contain NULL values unless the NOT NULL constraint is set explicitly.
All alternate keys can be candidate keys, but all candidate keys can not be alternate keys.
The primary key, which is also a candidate key, can not be considered as an alternate key.



Example
For a better understanding, let us create the above discussed table demonstrating the usage of the various keys and illustrating the fields that can be considered as alternate keys.

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID INT,
   NAME VARCHAR (20),
   AGE INT,
   AADHAAR_ID BIGINT,
   MOBILE_NO BIGINT,
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY(ID)      
);



INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh', 32, 90123498456, 9023456789, 22000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan', 25, 91123249545, 9032456578, 24500.34 ),
(3, 'Kaushik', 23, 91223242546, 9012436789, 20000.12 );



Candidate Key
A Candidate key is a subset of super keys that is used to uniquely identify records of a table. It can be a single field or multiple fields. The primary keys, alternate keys, foreign keys in a table are all types of candidate key.

Primary Key
A Primary Key is a main key that is used to retrieve records from a table. It is a single column or field in a table that uniquely identifies each record in a database table.

Foreign Key
The Primary key of one table will be the Foreign key in another table. While inserting values into these tables, values in the primary key field must match the values in the foreign key field; otherwise, the foreign key column will not accept the INSERT query and throws an error

Alternate Key
An Alternate key is a candidate key that could be a primary key but is not. Like primary key, it also uniquely identifies the records in a field of a table to retrieve row tuples from the said table. There can be a single or multiple fields identifying as alternate keys in a table.
