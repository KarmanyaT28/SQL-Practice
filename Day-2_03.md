To back up your MySQL databases or tables from your Mac terminal, you use the mysqldump utility. Unlike the commands you run inside the mysql> prompt, these are executed directly in your standard terminal prompt (% or $).

Here are the most common commands you will need:

1. Back up a Single Database
This is the standard command to export an entire database (like your personal_db) into a .sql file.

Bash
mysqldump -u root -p personal_db > personal_db_backup.sql
2. Back up a Specific Table
If you only want to back up the BUYERS table you just renamed:

Bash
mysqldump -u root -p personal_db BUYERS > buyers_table.sql
3. Back up All Databases
To back up every single database on your MySQL server:

Bash
mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > alldbs_backup.sql
4. Restore a Database
If you ever make a mistake and need to bring your data back, use the mysql command (not mysqldump):

Bash
mysql -u root -p personal_db < personal_db_backup.sql
Important Notes for Mac Users
The Password: When you run these, it will ask for your password. Type it and hit Enter (the cursor won't move while you type).

The > Symbol: This "redirects" the output. Instead of showing the data on your screen, it saves it into a file.

File Location: The backup file will be created in whichever folder your terminal is currently in (usually your User folder).
