SQL Cloning Operation allows to create the exact copy of an existing table along with its definition. There are three types of cloning possible using SQL in various RDBMS; they are listed below −

Simple Cloning
Shallow Cloning
Deep Cloning



Simple Cloning in MySQL
Simple cloning operation creates a new replica table from the existing table and copies all the records in newly created table. To break this process down, a new table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement; and the data from the existing table, as a result of SELECT statement, is copied into the new table.

Here, clone table inherits only the basic column definitions like the NULL settings and default values from the original table. It does not inherit the indices and AUTO_INCREMENT definitions.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax to perform simple cloning in MySQL−

CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT * FROM original_table;





Example
Consider the following existing CUSTOMERS table which will be cloned in next new few steps.

ID	NAME	AGE	ADDRESS	SALARY
1	Ramesh	32	Ahmedabad	2000.00
2	Khilan	25	Delhi	1500.00
3	Kaushik	23	Kota	2000.00
4	Chaitali	25	Mumbai	6500.00
5	Hardik	27	Bhopal	8500.00
6	Komal	22	Hyderabad	4500.00
7	Muffy	24	Indore	10000.00
Now let's use the following SQL statement to create NEW_CUSTOMERS table using the existing table CUSTOMERS.



CREATE TABLE NEW_CUSTOMERS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;





Shallow Cloning in MySQL
Shallow cloning operation creates a new replica table from the existing table but does not copy any data records into newly created table, so only new but empty table is created.

Here, the clone table contains only the structure of the original table along with the column attributes including indices and AUTO_INCREMENT definition..

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax to perform shallow cloning in MySQL RDBMS −

CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;

Example
Following is an example to create a shallow clone copy of the existing table CUSTOMERS.

CREATE TABLE SHALL_CUSTOMERS LIKE CUSTOMERS;


DESC SHALL_CUSTOMERS;



Deep Cloning in MySQL

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax to perform deep cloning in MySQL RDBMS −

CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;
INSERT INTO new_table SELECT * FROM original_table;



Example
Following is an example to create a deep clone copy of the existing table CUSTOMERS. First step is to create a shallow clone of the existing table.

CREATE TABLE DEEP_CUSTOMERS LIKE CUSTOMERS;


INSERT INTO DEEP_CUSTOMERS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;


SELECT * FROM DEEP_CUSTOMERS;
